# Learn you a Neo4j GDS Arrow for Great Good!

The notebooks in this project are meant to be used in order of Exercise number to build an understanding of using Neo4j GDS's Apache Arrow capabilities. Answers are provided in the `answers` directory.

All required data is provided as Apache Parquet files.

## Running

For local usage, if you have Docker, you can start up a Neo4j instance via `neo4j4.sh` and a Jupyter environment via `jupyter.sh`.

> Coming Soon: validation the notebooks work with Neo4j 5!

For in-class usage, (hopefully) there will be a hosted Neo4j instance you can connect to from something like Google Colab.

## One Last Thing

A GDS trial license is included in this project to make things easier for students. It's only good until the 8th of October 2022.
